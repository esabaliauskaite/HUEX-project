# Idea
Building a simple weather React single page responsive application. Weather API will be used to finish this project. MVP (Minimum Valuable Product) will be saving favorite cities, comparing temperature in those cities, search by city, getting forcast for 5 days, switching between Fahrenheit and Celcius, showing wind speed and feels like temperature, rain possibility, sunset and sunrise using graphs and animations for UI.
